~$ google-authenticator

Do you want authentication tokens to be time-based (y/n) Y

Do you want me to update your "/root/.google_authenticator" file? (y/n) Y

By default, three tokens are valid at any one time.  This accounts for
generated-but-not-used tokens and failed login attempts. In order to
decrease the likelihood of synchronization problems, this window can be
increased from its default size of 3 to 17. Do you want to do so? (y/n) N

If the computer that you are logging into isn't hardened against brute-force
login attempts, you can enable rate-limiting for the authentication module.
By default, this limits attackers to no more than 3 login attempts every 30s.
